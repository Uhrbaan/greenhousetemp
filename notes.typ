#show link: underline

= GreenHouse Temp Â°C
This project aims to create an app which notifies 
the user when the greenhouse is too hot.

Currently, it uses `go` as its backend language, with `sqlc` and #link("https://sqlite.org")[`sqlite`]
to store/get the data.

On the frontend, I've decided to learn the basics of #link("https://example.com")[_Android Studio_].

This document is mostly to show #link("https://typst.app")[Typst].
